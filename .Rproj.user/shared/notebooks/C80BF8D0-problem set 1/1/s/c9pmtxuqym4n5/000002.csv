## Prof's Logic: small sample 95% CI: uses mean ± qt(0.975, df = df)*root(var/n) for the t distribution
  # qt(0.975, df = df)


## Prof's Logic: double check with t.test where t.test(data$height) and uses t distribution
  # gives t stat, df, pvalue, and 95% CI and mean of x
  # wont be using t.test for normal distribution but instead z.test function that is part of BSDA package
